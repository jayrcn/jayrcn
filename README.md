### Kumusta Ka Na!~ ã…Žã…‡ì—¬!!~ Wassupp Yalllll!~ ðŸ‘‹
I'm James (Jay) Niere, a former UC Berkeley studying EECS Major (withdrew due to extenuating life/health circumstances, in process of transferring to another school as of now). During at my time at UCB however, I gradually became more passionate about growing as a software developer and building impactful projects in combination with my desire to combine techincal and creative skills.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m excited about learning new stacks and frameworks:
  - Currently, I prefer working with React/Next.js, HTML, and CSS (In general I prefer Front-End Work as a whole)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jameskyoto4@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak 3 langauges fluently for everyday life! (Tagalog, Korean, English) and I speak another 2 for basic conversation (Chinese, Japanese)

### Current Project
- [Spero](https://shopspero.org) - opening a virtual store showcasing Christian-themed merchandise as part of the remote marketing & sales solutions in response to COVID-19

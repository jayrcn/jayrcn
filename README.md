### Kumusta Ka Na!~ ã…Žã…‡ì—¬!!~ Wassupp Yalllll!~ ðŸ‘‹:zap:
I'm James (Jay) Niere, a current UC Berkeley studying EECS and during at my time at UCB however, I gradually became more passionate about growing as a software developer and building impactful projects in combination with my desire to combine techincal and creative skills. :technologist:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m excited about learning new stacks and frameworks:
  - Currently, I prefer working with React/Next.js, HTML, and CSS (In general I prefer Front-End Work as a whole)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jameskyoto4@gmail.com or jayniere@berkeley.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak 3 langauges fluently for everyday life! (Tagalog, Korean, English) and I speak another 2 for basic conversation (Chinese, Japanese)

### Current Project
- [Spero](https://shopspero.org) - opening a virtual store showcasing Christian-themed merchandise as part of the remote marketing & sales solutions in response to COVID-19
-  [Front-End Projects] - Front-End Projects soon to come!

### Previous Projects
- [Earthquake Data Analysis Project] Created a project analyzing and plotting the locations and magnitudes of strong earthquakes in the Southernmost region in the Philippines from 1970-2022
- [S1XT33N Voice Activated Car Project (C/C++ and Electrical Engineering Project)	] - Built a voice-activated car through electrical circuits and C/C++. Spent about 40+ hours on this project over the course of a few months with a partner.
- [NASA L'SPACE NPWEE Team Researcher] - Was in a team-researched-based academy that created a research proposal for NASA in which we presented our proposed research idea to a panel of engineers and scientists at NASA. I was the secondary project manager for this student research group.

### Publications

- 2019 (AP Seminar) - Researched on the relational aspect between income and crime rates in America and how it affected citizens in those regions psychologically
- 2019 (FFA Research) - Researched and discovered the affects of athletic performance in relation to consumption of GMO and NON-GMO foods. (Won a bronze level state award).
- 2021 (NASA Proposal Research) - Reseacrhed onn Quantum Interferometry and Signal Systems for Spacecraft and Telescopes. 

Abstract: Global needs for quantum sensors consist of climate change, seismic scanning for earthquakes, and density analysis for future NASA missions to other planets or celestial bodies. In order to optimize the sensor, it must be able to make remote measurements without much loss in accuracyâ€”a mechanical hatch system that works alongside an electronic receiver and transmitter would help with the measurement and collection of quantum sensor data sets. This project will attempt to synthesize current knowledge of technology and modern physics into a prototype that can be extended to uses in space and a proof of concept final paper that contains the efforts and detailed steps of the project.
